UBRI;Experimental;A1 & A2;TRUE;TRUE;TRUE;TRUE;Hotwire;NA;Experimental Aeroacoustic Database BLI Configuration A;This database contains the datasets for the aeroacoustic experiments conducted at the University of Bristol regarding Boundary Layer Ingestion configurations A1 and A2 as part of the H2020 ENODISE project.

Configuration A1 consists of a propeller ingesting a zero-pressure-gradient boundary layer while A2 is a propeller ingesting an adverse pressure gradient boundary layer in a partially buried configuration. Far-field acoustics are measured using two microphone arcs, near-field measurements consist of surface static pressure and pressure fluctuations. Propeller force and torque is measured using a load cell. Flow-field measurements are obtained through hotwire anemometry.

This forms part of Deliverable D3.3, see D3.3 report for further information regarding measurement techniques. Included are descriptive READMEs and instrumentation layouts. The data is in the HDF5 format and comprises mean, spectral, and other processed data types in engineering units.

Now updated with D3.6 to include cleaned CAD models of both A1 and A2 configurations in STEP formats.;https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10118963
DLR;Numerical;A1 & A2;FALSE;FALSE;FALSE;TRUE;NA;BEMT;Analytical Aeroacoustic Database BLI Configuration A1 and A2;This database contains the acoustic prediction results of DLR for a single operating point of the A1 and A2 configurations investigated in the framework of the European project ENODISE. In these configurations, a single two-bladed propeller is immersed in a boundary layer. The present results can be compared to the measurements carried out by the University of Bristol and the University of Twente for different boundary layer characteristics. The experimental results are saved elsewhere on the ZENODO repository.

The investigated operating point as calculated in the prediction is:

Uinf = 33 m/s, 6500 rpm, advance ratio J=1.
The experimental measurements were conducted at a slightly lower freestream velocity.

The DLR prediction results were obtained using the analytical approach implemented in the DLR in-house program PropNoise coupled to the blade element momentum theory. The calculations were informed by the hot-wire measurements carried out in the boundary-layer as the propeller was removed.
